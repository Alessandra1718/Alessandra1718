A bit of information that might be usefull to everyone: 
ℹ️                 🗒️                 ℹ️

   - 🐍 I am learning python currently 
   - 🤖 I have experince with the Arduino and it's coding langauge 
   - 💻 I am not looking to collaborate on projects at the very moment 
   - 🔠 I can communicate in Spanish as well as English. 
   - ⭐ the joke to my banner and profile picture is in the fact that one of the most used features on GitHub is the "Git Pull" feature 
     -> in French the word "Pull" or correctly spelled "Poule" (same pronunciation) means chiken
     -> so here are some code themed Git Poules!

     please do not reuse it without written permission from me)
