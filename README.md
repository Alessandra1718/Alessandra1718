A bit of information that might be usefull to everyone: 
ℹ️                 🗒️                 ℹ️

   - 🐍 I am currently learning python and Godot game making
   - 🔠 I have participated in Girls Who Code camps twice last year, and intend to continue participating  
   - 🤖 I have experince with the Arduino and its' coding langauge 
   - 💻 I am not looking to collaborate on projects at the moment 
   - 🔠 I speak English, Spanish, French, and Russian fluently, and am learning Italian and Norwegian right now. 
   - ⭐ the joke to my banner and profile picture is in the fact that one of the most used features on GitHub is the "Git Pull" feature 
     -> in French the word "Pull" or correctly spelled "Poule" (same pronunciation) means chicken
     -> so here are some code themed Git Poules!
